/**
 * TradingView anonymous chart-data provider.
 *
 * TradingView's free/anonymous data is exchange-dependent. Bare US equities may
 * resolve to free Cboe partial-market realtime data, while exchange-qualified
 * US symbols and many non-US exchanges are commonly delayed without paid
 * exchange entitlements. This provider is intentionally keyless and opt-in so
 * agents can use it as a free global intrabar fallback without mistaking
 * freshness or partial-market volume for broker/SIP quality.
