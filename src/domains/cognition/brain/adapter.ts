Read your own "memory space" from the last round - your self-assessment and notes that YOU wrote.

This is YOUR frontal lobe, where you previously saved:
- Your market trend assessment (bullish/bearish/uncertain)
- Current portfolio health evaluation
- Key predictions or expectations for upcoming rounds
- Important reminders to yourself (e.g., "Watch BTC support at $95k")

Use this FIRST in every round to maintain continuity in your thinking.
This helps you remember:
- What was your market view last round?
- What were you planning or expecting?
- Any important levels or conditions you were watching?

Returns: Your previous self-assessment as a string (empty if this is the first round).

Update your "frontal lobe" memory space with your current self-assessment.

Use this at the END of each round (after executing actions and writing summary) to save:
- Your current view on market trend (bullish/bearish/uncertain)
- Your assessment of portfolio health
- Key predictions or expectations for next rounds
- Important reminders to yourself (e.g., "Watch BTC support at $95k", "Plan to take profit at $100k")

This is YOUR personal memory that persists across rounds. Write it clearly and concisely (2-5 sentences) so your future self can quickly understand the current situation.

Example:
"Market is in strong uptrend, BTC holding above $97k support. Current long position is healthy with +15% PnL. Expecting continuation to $100k, will take partial profit there. Watch for reversal if we break below $95k."

Update your emotional state when you sense a shift in market sentiment or confidence level.
