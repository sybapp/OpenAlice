  How to use OpenAlice's `alice analysis` tools over K-lines keyed by barId:
  source discovery (`search-bars`), unified technical analysis
  (`technical-analysis`), and Quant Calculator (v2)
  scripts. Use whenever the task is technical/quantitative on price data:
  "RSI on BTC", "is AAPL above its 200-day", "50/200 golden cross check",
  "multi-timeframe momentum", "delta/CVD", "volume profile", "where is
  POC/value area", "FVG/iFVG", "order blocks", "BOS/CHoCH", "market structure",
  "how extended is X (z-score)", "does this track the sector (correlation)", "trend
  strength", "compare 1h/4h/12h at once". Start with
  `alice analysis search-bars` to find a barId, then use
  `technical-analysis` for a coherent market read or `quant` for custom scalar
  calculations.

# `alice analysis` — Quant Calculator (v2)

OpenAlice's analysis commands operate on K-lines by **barId**. Get barIds from
`alice analysis search-bars` first, then choose the analysis verb that matches
the question.

## Quick Index

| Need | Command | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Find K-line sources | `alice analysis search-bars` | Return broker/vendor `barId` candidates and freshness labels |
| Unified market read | `alice analysis technical-analysis` | Combine Price Action, approximate order flow, EMA/VWAP/Fibonacci, and confluence |
| Technical indicators / custom panels | `alice analysis quant` | RSI, MACD, moving averages, correlations, z-score, batches |

## The loop

```bash
alice analysis search-bars --query AAPL
# Pick a broker barId if one came back (realtime, matches your fills); fall back to a vendor only if not.
alice analysis technical-analysis --barId tradingview\|AAPL --assetClass equity --interval 15m --count 200
alice analysis quant --script $'s = bars("alpaca-paper|AAPL", "1d", count=250)\nsma(s.close, 50)'
```

For a compact multi-timeframe read, pass intervals in higher-timeframe-to-execution order:

```bash
alice analysis technical-analysis --barId tradingview\|AAPL --assetClass equity --intervals 4h,1h,15m --count 200
```

## Choosing a source

`search-bars` federates broker bars and vendor bars (freshest-first). Pick in
this order:

1. **A broker you actually trade** (`barCapability: "realtime"`) — freshest, and
   the chart matches your fills. Always prefer this when it's in the results.
2. **A paid vendor** (`fmp`, …) when no broker source exists.
3. **`yfinance` — free fallback only.** Its end-of-day bars can lag a **day or
   two**, so never use it for anything time-sensitive (a fresh signal, an entry
   check) or to chart a live position when a broker source is available.

Vendor barIds (`yfinance|…`, `fmp|…`) need `asset=`; broker barIds infer it.
Keyless exchange data sources such as `binance-readonly` are opt-in in
Trading settings, so do not assume they exist before `search-bars` returns them.

**No candidates for a non-US symbol?** `search-bars` only fans out over the
vendors that are *on*. A Taiwan or CN A-share searched by its native name can
come back empty just because its vendor is off — `alice market vendors` to see
what's available, `alice market vendor-set --vendor twse --enabled true` to add
it (live immediately), then re-run search-bars. See the `alice` skill.

TradingView is the broad free fallback for global intraday bars when enabled:
`tradingview|NASDAQ:AAPL`, `tradingview|HKEX:0700`, `tradingview|SZSE:300820`,
`tradingview|BINANCE:BTCUSDT`, `tradingview|FX:EURUSD`. Treat its freshness as
exchange-dependent and conservatively delayed unless verified; timestamps are
UTC.

## Unified Technical Analysis

Use `alice analysis technical-analysis` for one coherent read when the question
touches buying/selling pressure, CVD, volume concentration, POC/Value Area,
ICT/SMC structure, classic indicators, or confluence. It returns one interval
result containing Price Action, approximate Order Flow, and EMA/VWAP/Fibonacci
context. Pass `intervals` for a sequential multi-timeframe read.

### Order-flow portion

Estimates Delta Volume and Cumulative Delta (CVD). Each lower-timeframe intrabar
is classified by candle direction, its volume is signed, then intrabars are
aggregated into each target bar.

Key inputs:

- `barId`: required. Use `search-bars` first.
- `assetClass`: required for vendor barIds, such as `equity`, `crypto`, or
  `currency`.
- `interval`: target bar interval: `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, `1w`.
- `count` or `start`/`end`: requested window.

Returns per-bar `delta`, `cvd`, `deltaRatio`, `coverage`, and a confidence flag.
Low coverage means the lower-timeframe bars did not cover enough of the target
bar's volume; treat the result as weak evidence.

### Volume Profile portion

Builds a Volume Profile histogram from lower-timeframe intrabars inside the
requested target window.

Key inputs:

- `barId`, `assetClass`, `interval`, `count`, `start`, `end`: same source/window
  pattern as the unified technical-analysis call.
- `bins`: optional price-bin count. Higher is more granular; lower is more
  stable.

Returns price bins with volume, POC (Point of Control), Value Area high/low, and
metadata about the intrabar sample used.

### Intrabar selection is automatic

Do **not** pass an `intrabarInterval`. The tool chooses it.

- It picks the finest intrabar interval that keeps
  `requested_count * intrabars_per_parent <= 5000`.
- TradingView can use internal `3m` intrabars between `1m` and `5m`.
- If the finest interval would exceed the cap, the tool falls back to coarser
  intrabars or reduces `count`.
- The response `meta` reports `intrabarInterval`, `intrabarTimeframe`,
  `requestedCount`, `actualCount`, `truncated`, and `degradationReason`.

Examples:

- `1d` target * 100 bars usually uses `1h` intrabars.
- `1h` target * 100 bars may fall back from `1m` to `3m`.
- `15m` target * 100 bars usually uses `1m` intrabars.

### Price Action portion

Use the Price Action portion when the question is about ICT/SMC-style structure:
Fair Value Gaps, inverse FVGs, trend continuation/reversal breaks, liquidity
zones, or whether current price is near an imbalance.

It detects:

- **FVG / VI / OG:** standard three-candle Fair Value Gaps,
  Volume Imbalance body gaps, and Opening Gaps. Use `gapMode` to pick
  `FVG`, `VI`, `OG`, or `all`; use `zoneMitigationSource` as `body`, `wick`,
  or `midpoint` (default `body`), or `fvgZoneMitigationSource` to override
  only FVG/VI/OG zone mitigation.
  The result includes both `formationIndex` and `confirmationIndex`; by default
  the confirmation candle gets lower-timeframe intrabar delta confirmation when
  available.
- **iFVG (Inverse FVG):** a confirmed subset of FVG breaker zones. The source
  FVG must break through its far edge, create a breaker with reversed direction,
  then show reversal/impulse confirmation; each iFVG links back to that breaker.
  By default the reversal candle gets lower-timeframe intrabar delta
  confirmation when available.
- **OB (Order Block):** volumetric order block: after a
  BOS/CHoCH, locate the extreme candle between the broken swing and breakout,
  derive a zone, and mark it mitigated when the configured zone trigger source
  reaches the mitigation boundary. By default the tool also tries to attach lower-timeframe intrabar
  delta confirmation for the OB anchor candle and breakout candle, including
  delta ratio, coverage, confidence, and whether the delta direction agrees
  with the OB direction. When anchor intrabars are available, it also estimates
  `internalBuyVolume` / `internalSellVolume` and their percentages from the
  anchor candle's intrabar delta. Overlapping OBs are hidden by default using
  Pine-style overlap filtering. Use `orderBlockZoneMitigationSource` to
  override OB mitigation separately from the shared `zoneMitigationSource`.
- **BOS (Break of Structure):** continuation break of the active structure.
- **CHoCH (Change of Character):** reversal break that flips the
  active structure state.
- **CHoCH+:** CHoCH with stronger opposing swing context. The tool reports it
  via `isPlus: true`.
- **Structure modes and strong/weak swings:** `marketStructureMode` defaults to
  `pivot`; use `extreme` when you want cleaner top-down structure with minor
  pivots compressed into active extremes. `adjusted` is not a public mode.
- **Liquidity and location context:** the v2 result always includes
  `premiumDiscount`, `liquidityPools`, `liquiditySweeps`, and `breakers`.
  Zone-like results may include premium/discount annotations.

Key inputs:

- `barId`: required. Use `search-bars` first.
- `assetClass`: required for vendor barIds.
- `interval`: analysis interval, such as `15m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`.
- `count` or `start`/`end`: requested window.
- `gapMode`, `zoneMitigationSource`, `fvgZoneMitigationSource`,
  `gapVolumeConfirmation`, `minGapAtrMultiplier`, `minBodyRatio`: gap type,
  mitigation trigger source, volume confirmation, and ATR-normalized noise
  filters for FVG/VI/OG detection.
- `maxFVGs`, `maxIFVGs`, `includeFilled`, `proximityPct`: result filters.
- `maxIFVGLookAheadBars`, `ifvgVolumeConfirmation`, `minImpulseRatio`,
  `minEngulfingStrength`: iFVG confirmation filters.
- `maxOrderBlocks`, `includeMitigatedOrderBlocks`, `orderBlockTrigger`,
  `orderBlockPosition`, `orderBlockZoneMitigationSource`,
  `overlapPolicy`, `orderBlockVolumeConfirmation`: OB result, zone,
  mitigation, ranked overlap, and intrabar delta confirmation controls.
- `internalLookback`, `swingLookback`, `externalLookback`: swing lengths.
  Defaults are `5`, `20`, and `50`.
- `marketStructureMode`: `pivot` or `extreme` (default `pivot`).
- `liquidityPoolToleranceAtrMultiplier`, `liquidityPoolTolerancePctCap`,
  `minLiquidityPoolTouches`, `liquidityPoolLevels`: EQH/EQL liquidity-pool
  controls.

Returns ranked FVG/VI/OG/iFVG zones, OB zones with mitigation status, intrabar
delta confirmation and OB internal buy/sell activity when available, swing
points, strong/weak swing context, liquidity pools/sweeps, breaker zones,
premium/discount context, BOS/CHoCH breaks, and `stateByLevel` for current
internal/swing/external structure. The single-timeframe result uses schema v2
and top-down key order: `marketStructure`, `premiumDiscount`,
`liquidityPools`, `liquiditySweeps`, `fvgs`, `ifvgs`, `orderBlocks`,
`breakers`, `meta`.
Volume confirmation is approximate lower-timeframe bar delta, not tick/order-book
data; check `coverage` and `confidence` before treating it as reliable. For FVG
it is an auxiliary quality signal, not part of the gap definition.
For zone mitigation sources, `body` uses the adverse candle body edge
(`min(open, close)` for bullish zones and `max(open, close)` for bearish
zones), `wick` uses the adverse wick, and `midpoint` triggers when that body
edge reaches the zone midpoint.

Pass `intervals: ["4h", "1h", "15m"]` when you need a multi-timeframe summary.
The top-level result returns condensed trend alignment, conflicts, confluences,
and one full technical-analysis result per interval.

### Indicator and confluence portion

The unified result includes:

- EMA fast/slow/long values and ordered bias (`bullish`, `bearish`, `mixed`, or
  `unavailable`). Defaults are 12/20/50.
- VWAP with `auto`, rolling, session, week, month, year, and structure anchors.
  The relation is `above`, `below`, `at`, or `unavailable`; missing positive
  volume is reported as a warning.
- Fibonacci retracements anchored to the latest usable swing structure leg.
  Each level reports its ratio, price, touch, cross, and active/broken state.
- Confluence zones that group distinct EMA, VWAP, and Fibonacci families within
  an ATR-normalized distance. Each zone reports its support/resistance/pivot
  classification, component prices, family list, and strength.

The defaults are visible in `indicators.configuration`. Use `indicators` only
when a different period, anchor, Fibonacci level set, or confluence threshold is
needed. Use `priceAction` for detector tuning; `mode=execution` enables the
lower-timeframe confirmation path, while `mode=debug` also returns raw delta and
profile views.

## Language

`quant` is a bounded, side-effect-free expression language for technical
analysis. A script is zero or more `name = ...` bindings, then a final result
expression:

```python
s = bars("alpaca-paper|AAPL", "1d", count=250)
sma(s.close, 50) - sma(s.close, 200)        # +ve = 50 above 200 (uptrend)
```

**`bars(barId, interval, count=, asOf=, start=, end=, asset=)`**
- `barId`: `"{source}|{symbol}"` from search-bars. Broker (`alpaca-paper|AAPL`)
  or opt-in keyless exchange data (`binance-readonly|BTC/USDT`) needs NO
  `asset=`; vendor (`yfinance|AAPL`, `fmp|AAPL`) needs
  `asset="equity"|"crypto"|"currency"|"commodity"`.
- `interval`: `1m 5m 15m 30m 1h 4h 1d 1w`.
- Window: `count=N` (most-recent N bars — the natural window for indicators), OR
  `start=/end=` (YYYY-MM-DD date range), OR `end=+count=` (point-in-time backtest).

**Columns** of a bars() series: `s.open / s.high / s.low / s.close / s.volume`.

**Indexing:** raw columns are series — index them: `s.close[-1]` (latest),
`s.close[-2]` (one back). **Indicators already return the latest scalar — do NOT
index them** (`sma(s.close, 50)`, not `sma(...)[-1]`).

**Arithmetic:** `+ - * /`, parentheses, unary minus.

## Panels — batch many computations in one call

The result can be a **labeled dict** or a **positional list** (each entry a single
value, max 200). Use this instead of calling the tool N times:

```python
h1 = bars("yfinance|BTC-USD", "1h", count=250, asset="crypto")
h4 = bars("yfinance|BTC-USD", "4h", count=250, asset="crypto")
d1 = bars("yfinance|BTC-USD", "1d", count=250, asset="crypto")
{ "1h": rsi(h1.close, 14), "4h": rsi(h4.close, 14), "1d": rsi(d1.close, 14) }
```
→ `{ "1h": 53.2, "4h": 48.9, "1d": 61.4 }`

## Sibling verbs — dated reads & backtests

`quant` returns latest scalars with no dates. When you need the time axis or a
hypothetical trade, reach for these instead (see the `retrospective` skill for
the full workflow):

- **`alice analysis snapshot --query XLE [--asOf YYYY-MM-DD]`** — the honest
  as-of read: DATED bars (never past `asOf` — no lookahead), the latest print
  (close + vs-prevClose + day high/low + amplitude), compact levels, and a
  **freshness contract** (`isLatestActual` / `staleTradingDays`). Use this for
  "what does/did X look like", not a hand-rolled quant dump.
- **`alice analysis simulate --query XLE --entryDate … --exitRule …`** —
  backtest one entry + one exit (`trailing_stop`/`ma_break`/`stop`/`target`/
  `hold`); returns entry/exit, returnPct, MFE/MAE.
- **`alice analysis quant … --dates`** — opt-in date axis on a quant result
  (`dates[barId]` for one interval; `dates["barId@interval"]` when the same
  barId is used at multiple intervals), to map a dumped series back to days.

## Function catalog

| Group | Functions |
|---|---|
| Trend | `sma(s, n)` `ema(s, n)` `macd(s, fast, slow, signal)` `slope(s, n)` (signed, rankable trend) |
| Momentum | `rsi(s, n=14)` `roc(s, n)` (% change over n) |
| Volatility | `stdev(s)` `atr(high, low, close, n)` `bbands(s, n, std)` `zscore(s, n?)` (how extended vs window) |
| Volume | `rvol(volume, n=20)` `obv(close, volume)` `mfi(high, low, close, volume, n=14)` `vwap(high, low, close, volume)` |
| Stats | `max/min/sum/average/median(s)` `highest(s, n)` `lowest(s, n)` |
| Comparison | `correlation(a, b)` (−1..1; relative strength / pairs / "tracks the sector?") |

Records: `bbands` → `{upper, middle, lower}`; `macd` → `{macd, signal, histogram}`.

## Examples

> Examples below use `yfinance|…` for brevity (it's always available without a
> broker). When you have a broker source for the symbol, swap its barId in —
> see *Choosing a source*.

```python
# Momentum % over the last 20 bars
s = bars("yfinance|AAPL", "1d", count=60, asset="equity")
roc(s.close, 20)

# How overbought/oversold vs the trailing 20 sessions
s = bars("yfinance|TSLA", "1d", count=60, asset="equity")
zscore(s.close, 20)

# Does this token move with BTC? (relative strength)
btc = bars("yfinance|BTC-USD", "1d", count=90, asset="crypto")
sui = bars("yfinance|SUI-USD", "1d", count=90, asset="crypto")
correlation(btc.close, sui.close)

# A one-call dashboard
s = bars("yfinance|NVDA", "1d", count=250, asset="equity")
{
  "rsi":        rsi(s.close, 14),
  "roc_20d_%":  roc(s.close, 20),
  "vs_200ma":   s.close[-1] - sma(s.close, 200),
  "trend":      slope(s.close, 50),
  "z_20d":      zscore(s.close, 20),
  "atr_14":     atr(s.high, s.low, s.close, 14),
}
```

## Self-correction

On failure the tool returns `{ error: { kind, message, suggestion } }`, not a
crash — read it and fix the script. It pinpoints the problem: unknown function
(with "did you mean"), wrong arity/type, insufficient bars (raise `count=`),
undeclared name, and common Python reflexes (`s.close.rolling(50).mean()` →
"use `sma(s.close, 50)`"; `sma(...)[-1]` → "drop the [-1]"; slices/`if` → not
supported here).

## Gotchas

- Indicators return the latest **scalar** — never `[-1]` them; only raw columns
  are series.
- Vendor barIds need `asset=`; broker barIds infer it.
- **Source freshness:** `yfinance`/`fmp` are delayed (yfinance EOD can lag a day
  or two). Prefer a broker barId for anything you trade or anything time-sensitive.
- No conditionals/booleans (no `if`, no crossover operator) — compute the parts
  and compare in your own reasoning, or return them in a panel.
- For arbitrary/looping logic beyond these primitives, spawn a separate
  Auto-Quant workspace, not this tool.
