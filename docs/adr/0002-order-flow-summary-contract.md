# Keep technical-analysis summaries descriptive and fidelity-aware

OpenAlice will deepen the existing OHLCV-derived Delta Proxy instead of presenting it as native order flow or expanding it into order-book, tape, footprint, or trade-order lifecycle analysis. Order Flow remains an internal deep module, while `analyzeTechnicalAnalysis` is the single agent-facing analysis tool. Its compact result combines Price Action, order-flow context, EMA/VWAP/Fibonacci indicators, and confluence zones; debug mode can expose the raw delta/profile views when investigation requires them.

The internal `analyzeOrderFlowContext` contract remains stable so Price Action can
reuse the same intrabar load and confirmation evidence without fetching the
target window twice. It is not registered as a separate public tool.

The summary describes observable context rather than prescribing a trade direction or entry. It reports current price location relative to POC and value area, window-scoped HVN/LVN nodes and volume gaps, confirmed-pivot CVD divergence candidates, window-relative absorption candidates, short-sequence exhaustion candidates, and the numeric evidence and source indexes behind each result. Detection defaults stay named and testable rather than becoming public tuning inputs; applied thresholds and sample information remain visible, and each candidate type returns at most its three most-recent events with total and truncation metadata.

Every result identifies its fidelity as `bar_proxy` while retaining `isApproximation: true`; fidelity describes the evidence source and is separate from confidence in that evidence. Reliability is gated per component: insufficient sample size, intrabar coverage, or degraded data suppresses unsupported candidates with an explicit unavailable reason without discarding other usable facts. Because the bar contract cannot prove that the source's latest bar is complete, the summary reports `barCompletion: 'unknown'`, and absorption or exhaustion evidence involving that bar is marked provisional; confirmed-pivot divergence cannot use an unconfirmed endpoint.

Correctness is established with deterministic synthetic OHLCV and intrabar fixtures covering positive, negative, boundary, low-coverage, degraded, and provisional cases, plus invariants for explainability. Backtest profitability and live-provider snapshots are not correctness gates because this module describes market structure and does not define a trading strategy.
